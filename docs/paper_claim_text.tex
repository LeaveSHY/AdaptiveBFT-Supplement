\paragraph{Formal-verification claim boundary.}
Our artifact provides a reviewer-reproducible bounded formal verification
campaign for AdaptiveBFT in TLA+, with explicit assumptions and explicit
non-claims. Concretely, safety and liveness are checked over finite domains
using TLC, and complemented by machine-checked theorem-track artifacts in
TLAPS/SANY under a stated assumption envelope (eventual synchrony/fairness,
bounded adaptive adversary, and symbolic cryptographic abstraction).
Accordingly, our validated claim is:
\emph{under explicit assumptions, AdaptiveBFT satisfies the checked
safety/liveness properties in systematically explored bounded executions, with
reproducible proof-track evidence}.
We do not claim a closed full-concrete unbounded proof in this artifact release.

\paragraph{Reproducibility path.}
The release can be reproduced via:
\texttt{make gate-strong},
\texttt{make bundle},
\texttt{make release-status},
\texttt{make fastlane FASTLANE\_SKIP\_BUNDLE=1},
\texttt{make claim-check},
and \texttt{make check-sync}.
The consolidated release dashboard is in
\texttt{docs/results/release\_status\_latest.md}, and the
submission-ready summary is in
\texttt{docs/results/submission\_rc\_latest.md}.
